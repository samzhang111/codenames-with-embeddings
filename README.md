# Codenames and The Little Alchemist via word embeddings

These are implementations of [Codenames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codenames_(board_game)) and [Little Alchemy](https://littlealchemy2.com/) using static word embeddings in Spacy. It is designed to be as simple to use as possible to give a sense for the versatility of word embeddings, especially for applied mathematicians.
